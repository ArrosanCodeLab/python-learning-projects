# 🐍 Python Learning Projects

Welcome to **ArrosanCodeLab’s Python Learning Projects** – a curated collection of beginner-friendly Python projects that I, **Arrosan Rajalingam**, am building as part of my journey to learn Python.

## ✨ Why this repository?

I recently started learning Python, and to make the learning fun and effective, I began building **small, simple projects**. I'm truly enjoying the process — and I believe the best way to learn is by doing!

If you're also starting to learn Python, or curious about what I'm learning, feel free to **follow along** and explore these mini-projects. Each project comes with:
- ✅ Clean, working code
- 📝 Clear explanations and structure
- 📦 Real beginner use cases
